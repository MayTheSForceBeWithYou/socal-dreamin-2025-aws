echo "----------------------------------------------------"
echo "1. Run the user proxy script:"
echo "   python3 scripts/opensearch-user-proxy.py $PORT"
echo ""
echo "2. Keep that terminal open (don't close it)"
echo ""
echo "3. In your browser, go to: http://localhost:$PORT/_dashboards/"

echo "4. You'll be authenticated as the OpenSearch user (os_admin/password)"

echo "Method 2: AWS Console (Alternative)"
echo "-----------------------------------"
echo "1. Go to AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/"
echo "2. Navigate to OpenSearch service"
echo "3. Find your domain: salesforce-opensearch-lab-os"
echo "4. Look for 'OpenSearch Dashboards' button (not just URL)"
echo "5. Click that button for automatic authentication"
echo ""

echo "Method 3: Direct Browser Access"
echo "-------------------------------"
echo "1. Open your browser"
echo "2. Go to: $OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT/_dashboards/"
echo "3. Sign in with your AWS credentials when prompted"

echo "Method 4: CLI Testing"
echo "--------------------"
echo "Test OpenSearch connectivity:"
echo "  curl -X GET '$OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT/'"

echo "Method 5: EC2 Access (Guaranteed to Work)"
echo "-----------------------------------------"
echo "SSH into your EC2 instance and test from there:"
echo "  ssh -i aws/certs/aws-ec2 ec2-user@52.52.231.148"

echo "For AWS Console access, use Method 2."
