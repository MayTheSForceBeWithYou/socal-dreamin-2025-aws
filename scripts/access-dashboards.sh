echo "Method 2: AWS Console (Alternative)"
echo "-----------------------------------"

echo "2. Navigate to OpenSearch service"
echo "3. Find your domain: sf-opensearch-lab-os"
echo "4. Click 'OpenSearch Dashboards URL'"
echo "5. You'll be automatically authenticated with your AWS credentials"
echo ""

echo "Method 3: SSH to Bastion (For Advanced Users)"
echo "---------------------------------------------"
echo "1. SSH into bastion host:"
echo "   ssh -i aws/certs/aws-ec2 ec2-user@$BASTION_IP"
echo ""
echo "2. Check nginx status:"
echo "   sudo systemctl status nginx"
echo ""
echo "3. View logs:"
echo "   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log"
echo ""

echo "Method 4: CLI Access (For Testing)"
echo "----------------------------------"
echo "Test OpenSearch connectivity from bastion:"
echo "  ssh -i aws/certs/aws-ec2 ec2-user@$BASTION_IP"
echo "  curl -X GET 'https://localhost/'"
echo ""

echo "üìã Troubleshooting:"
echo "  - SSL Certificate Error: Click 'Advanced' ‚Üí 'Proceed to $BASTION_IP'"
echo "  - Connection Refused: Check bastion host status"
echo "  - Access Denied: Verify your IP is in allowed_cidr_blocks"
echo ""

echo "üîê Security Notes:"
echo "  - Only your IP can access the bastion host"
echo "  - All traffic is encrypted via HTTPS"
echo "  - OpenSearch uses AWS IAM authentication"
echo ""

echo "üìù Recommendation:"
echo "Use Method 1 (IP Gateway) for the easiest and most secure access to OpenSearch Dashboards."
